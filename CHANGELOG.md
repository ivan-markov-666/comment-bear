# Changelog

All notable changes to the Comment Bear project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- Removed the GitHub Actions CI workflow and the CI badge from the README (the badge image broke once the workflow was removed). Tests still run locally via `npm test` / `npm run test:coverage`. No runtime code changed since 1.2.0.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-01

Grew comment-bear from 21 to **80+ languages** on top of a new shared engine,
fixed every issue from the code audit, and added a coverage gate.
All changes are backwards compatible. Tests: 1043 → **1383**.

### Added
- **Shared comment-removal engine** (`removeBySpec` in `src/removers/_shared.ts`) that is aware of string/character literals, handles nested block comments, preserves license and directive comments, and supports `keepEmptyLines`. Most languages are now driven by a small declarative `CommentSpec`.
- **59 new languages**, grouped by comment family:
  - Hash (`#`): Shell/Bash, PowerShell, Perl (incl. POD blocks), R, TOML, Makefile, Dockerfile, INI, GraphQL, Elixir, Crystal, Julia, Nim, CoffeeScript, Tcl, CMake, Java `.properties`, Puppet, HCL/Terraform, SCSS, LESS, Sass.
  - C-style (`//`, `/* */`): Dart, Groovy/Gradle, Solidity, Protobuf, Objective-C (incl. `@"..."` literals), Zig, Vala, D (`/+ +/` nested blocks), GLSL, HLSL, WGSL, JSON5.
  - Dash (`--`): Lua (long-bracket strings/comments), Elm, Ada, VHDL, AppleScript.
  - Lisp/asm (`;`): Clojure, Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Assembly.
  - Percent (`%`): Erlang, LaTeX (`\%` aware), MATLAB (`%{ %}`), Prolog.
  - ML-style (`(* *)`): OCaml, F#, Standard ML, Pascal.
  - Other: VB/VBA (`'`, `REM`), Batch (`REM`, `::`), Fortran (`!`), Vimscript (line-start `"`).
  - Hybrid/templating: Vue and Svelte (section-aware — `<template>`/`<script>`/`<style>` handled by the HTML/JS/CSS removers) and Markdown (HTML comments removed, but fenced code blocks and inline code spans preserved).
- **Smarter detection**: by shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` → shell, etc.) and by special filename (`Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.vimrc`).
- `keepEmptyLines` support for the HTML, CSS, XML, SQL and JSON removers.
- `mergeConfig` and `validateConfig` are now re-exported from the package entry point.
- Optional `onlyAtLineStart` flag on the engine's line-comment spec (used by Vimscript; purely additive).
- Coverage gate via `jest` `coverageThreshold` (run with `npm run test:coverage`), so coverage regressions are caught.

### Changed
- Fixed npm metadata: `repository`/`bugs`/`homepage` now point at the `comment-bear` repo; added `author` and `engines` (Node >= 16).
- Cross-platform `clean` script (Node `fs.rmSync` instead of `rm -rf`); added `prepublishOnly` (build + test) and `test:coverage` scripts.
- Rewrote the README with a concise feature list, a full grouped language table, hybrid examples and documented limitations.

### Fixed
- YAML: `#` is now only treated as a comment at line start or after whitespace, so values like `url: http://x#frag` and `color:#fff` are preserved.
- PHP: `#[Attribute]` (PHP 8 attributes) are no longer removed as comments.
- Go: `//go:build`, `//go:embed`, `//go:generate` directives are preserved (in addition to `// +build`).
- CSS: comment-like sequences inside string/`content` values (e.g. `content: "a/*b*/c"`) are no longer corrupted.
- SCSS/LESS/Sass: `//` line comments are now removed (previously left untouched because these mapped to the CSS remover).
- CLI: `--language` now truly forces the language even when the file extension is recognised.
- Inline comment removal no longer leaves trailing whitespace.

### Known limitations
- MATLAB/Octave: only `"`-strings are tracked, not `'` (also the transpose operator); reachable via `--language matlab` (`.m` maps to Objective-C).
- Fortran: only free-form `!` comments (not fixed-form column-1 `C`/`*`).
- Vimscript: only full-line `"` comments are removed; inline `"` is left intact.
- Prolog: reachable only via explicit `--language prolog` (`.pl` maps to Perl).
