# Changelog

All notable changes to the Comment Bear project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Shared comment-removal engine (`removeBySpec` in `src/removers/_shared.ts`) that is aware of string/character literals, nested block comments, license/directive preservation and `keepEmptyLines`.
- 22 hash-family languages: Shell/Bash, PowerShell, Perl (incl. POD blocks), R, TOML, Makefile, Dockerfile, INI, GraphQL, Elixir, Crystal, Julia, Nim, CoffeeScript, Tcl, CMake, Java `.properties`, Puppet, HCL/Terraform, SCSS, LESS, Sass.
- 12 C-style languages: Dart, Groovy/Gradle, Solidity, Protobuf, Objective-C (incl. `@"..."` literals), Zig, Vala, D (`/+ +/` nested blocks), GLSL, HLSL, WGSL, JSON5.
- 22 more languages across the remaining comment families: Lua (long-bracket strings/comments), Elm, Ada, VHDL, AppleScript, Clojure, Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Assembly, Erlang, LaTeX (`\%` aware), MATLAB (`%{ %}`), Prolog, OCaml, F#, Standard ML, Pascal, VB/VBA (`'`, `REM`), Batch (`REM`, `::`), Fortran (`!`), Vimscript (line-start `"`).
- Optional `onlyAtLineStart` flag on the shared engine's line-comment spec (used by Vimscript; purely additive).
- Language detection by shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` → shell, etc.) and by special filename (`Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `CMakeLists.txt`).
- `keepEmptyLines` support for HTML, CSS, XML, SQL and JSON removers.
- `mergeConfig` and `validateConfig` are now re-exported from the package entry point.
- GitHub Actions CI (Node 18/20/22 × Ubuntu/Windows/macOS) with type-check, build, test and a coverage job.
- 220 new tests (total 1263+).

### Changed
- Fixed npm metadata: `repository`/`bugs`/`homepage` now point at the `comment-bear` repo; added `author` and `engines` (Node >= 16).
- Cross-platform `clean` script (Node `fs.rmSync` instead of `rm -rf`); added `prepublishOnly` (build + test) and `test:coverage` scripts.

### Fixed
- YAML: `#` is now only treated as a comment at line start or after whitespace, so values like `url: http://x#frag` and `color:#fff` are preserved.
- PHP: `#[Attribute]` (PHP 8 attributes) are no longer removed as comments.
- Go: `//go:build`, `//go:embed`, `//go:generate` directives are preserved (in addition to `// +build`).
- CSS: comment-like sequences inside string/`content` values (e.g. `content: "a/*b*/c"`) are no longer corrupted.
- SCSS/LESS/Sass: `//` line comments are now removed (previously left untouched because these mapped to the CSS remover).
- CLI: `--language` now truly forces the language even when the file extension is recognised.
- Inline comment removal no longer leaves trailing whitespace.
